Mountains of gold and silver surround you.
Precious gems can be seen littered throughout the room.
Something doesn't seem right.
...
A shroud of darkness appears from the depths of the cave.
This dark-cloaked figure points directly at you with hand of bones.
His eyes burn with hate as he says:

"This place is not meant for mortals."
...
"Since you made it this far, you may take some treasure with you."
"How many pieces of treasure do you desire?"
PROMPT
1. "You are one greedy mortal!"
The ghoulish figure grabs your neck with invisible arms and lifts you off the ground.
You can't breathe. You feel as though your soul is being ripped from your body when.
...
+++
You reach for anything that can help.
Of course! The sword!
You swing wildly in front of you slicing right through the neck of your attacker.
Darkness oozes from the wound and pulsates with a green glow.
Your body drops to the ground as the monster screams in agony.
...
GG: The treasure is yours! You are now the richest person in the world!
---
You reach for anything in your pocket.
The flashlight you had on you doesn't help.
GAMEOVER: The world fades away into darkness and the maniacal laughter of your killer echoes into nothing.
STOP
2. "You could've asked for %d! Muahahaha!"
You are allowed to leave with the measely treasure you requested.
GAMEOVER: You forever regret that you didn't ask for more.
STOP
3. The monster becomes infuriated that you don't want a single piece of the treasure.
GAMEOVER: It burns you alive with his fiery gaze.
STOP
ELSE: "That doesn't answer my question!"
GAMEOVER: You spontaniously combust.
STOP

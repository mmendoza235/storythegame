You walk through the door into a dark-smelly room.
You can hear your heartbeat inside your head slowly pulsing and getting louder with every beat.
...
Standing in front of you is a large squid-like beast with wings. But he doesn't notice you.
His attention is firmly locked onto the doorway on the other side of the room.
...
To the right, you can barely see the opening to a secret passageway.
Directly behind the beast lies an ancient rusted sword. What do you do?
1. Politely ask the beast for directions.
2. Quickly grab the sword and head for the passageway
3. Don't chance getting the beast's attention and quietly leave.

1. "Excuse me," you nervously ask.
The monster slowly gazes in your direction.

2. ITEM: sword
You inch your way toward the sword. You are about to grab it when.
...
You step on a rubber duckie! The noise pierces the air as you squint in terror.
You can hear your heart beat louder and faster than ever before.
...
Opening your eyes reveals the beast unaffected by your disturbance!
You quickly grab the sword and head for the exit.

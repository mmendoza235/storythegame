The cavern is so dark, you use the rock wall to guide yourself further.
The wall is strangely slimey.
...
At the end of the cavern, you see a faint glow of candlelight. What do you do?
1. Turn back and leave this stupid cave!
2. Poke and examine the slimy wall.
3. Head toward the light!
PROMPT
1. The slimy-scaly wall begins to move and surround you.
A horrifying hissing noise reminds you of something.
...
You quickly realize you had a flashlight the whole time!
Turning on the flashlight reveals.
...
Yup, just as you thought. A giant snake!
GAMEOVER: The snake swallows you whole!

You can't make up your mind and decide to sit down to rest.

GAMEOVER: You are dead!
STOP
